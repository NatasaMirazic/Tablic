# Tablic

## Description

“Tablic” is a very popular card game that is created as an internal project for my portfolio. This is a two-player game, between human and computer player. **This game is made only for desktop devices.**

In the beginning, a deck is shuffled and application deal six cards to computer and human from the deck. Also, four cards are on the talon (table). Some of the cards bring points and they call “full” cards. The goal of the game is to get as many cards from the table as possible ie. as many points as possible.

Table card can be taken when the value of the human/computer card is the same as the value of the table card or when the sum of table cards is the same or divisible with human/computer card. Cards that are taken are collected and points are summed for each player. The player which take more cards in one round has three extra points for that round. Also, when a player takes all cards on the table, he gets one ‘table’ ie. one point.

The game is finished when one of the players collects 101 points.
